# HackerNews Desktop

This project is a desktop client written in C++/Qt(QtQuick) for accessing Hacker News website content. It has features for voting, viewing and sending comments, sending news, and opening links. Unfortunately, some features, like logging into accounts, stop working randomly due to the lack of proper API.
